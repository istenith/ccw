        <h2>What happened to Chandrayaan 2 Orbiter(or Lander) after it lost its contact with Earth?</h2><br>
        <p>
            Mission accomplished”, Said ‘Lunas 58’, after shooting the Vikram lander. He was the best shooter in the colony of “Lunases” living in the South Polar Region of moon. The South Pole region was the only region left on the moon where 'lunases' (The natural population of the moon) are still surviving. <br><br>
            “Why are the people living on the earth so excited to meet us?”, asked the Head of the Lunas. “Maybe they want to establish relations with us.” Answered  the Lieutenant-general of the Lunas army. “These earth creatures will never understand us, they just want to establish their dominance. They are also more developed and have more resources than us.”, said Lieutenant Commander interrupting the Lt General. “As of now, the people of lunas need not worry, we have destroyed the alien device coming to our surface.”, said the Chief of Lunas army confidently.<br><br>
            Meanwhile on Earth, ISRO, after the failure of its lunar mission, contacted NASA for help to locate the lander. “Our satellite will reach that part of moon on 10th of September, we will try to locate it.”, said the NASA official on other side. Indian orbiter was also active but was not able to locate the lander.<br><br>
            “Please, bring the debris of the alien device”, said the Chief Scientist of Lunas to the Head of Lunas. “It will help us to understand the technology of earth.” On order of the Head, workers collected all the debris and placed it in the national laboratory of Lunas. Lunas scientists started their investigation on Vikram lander, as soon it reached the laboratory.<br><br>
            On next day on moon, people of Lunas got news that alien device which was approaching their region was destroyed.<br><br>
            Both worlds are in no contact to each other and know absolutely nothing about nothing about each other. Both worlds are in constant struggle of maintaining their race alive and getting to know each other but also have fear of losing everything if they reveal their identity.<br><br>
            On 10TH September when NASA orbiter reached the south pole of moon, they couldn’t find Vikram lander as it was already taken into custody of the Lunases. They tried again on 6th October and 24TH October but were not able to find it and even today no country has been successful in locating the location of Vikram lander as if it disappeared off the surface of moon.  <br><br>
