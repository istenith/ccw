            <p class="story-card" onclick="showMore(event)">Parallel perplex Countdown 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Lift off The chandrayaan 2 has lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, India, aboard a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket on this day of July 22, 2019 and is set to reach its lunar orbit on 19th August 2019. Pragyan and vikram shared a smooth journey with the orbiter till the 7th of September and now it was time for it to say goodbye to their journey partner, who was supposed to be their buddy for the times to come as they had to live together from then onwards as they had to explore the horizons of moon. But it was the time when vikran was set to go on the moon that the trouble TRICKED all. Remember that here I'm saying tricked, because the tragedy that was about to follow was not a failure, rather it was a trick of science. As lander began its descent, it achieved ultimate speeds. Still, there was one technical error, the engines which were supposed to make a smooth landing for the lander started working in the opposite direction and that too before they were needed. This led to speeding up of the lander and it reached ultimate speeds beyond that of light. Such a speed led it to travel through the space, into the parallel universe called magnus. The same mission being carried out in magnus showed no confusion for the scientists at ISRO(magnus) As they faced a similar problem with the other piece of chandrayaan. All they saw was a rover which worked well on their moon and sent out signals, whereas their orbiter showed no connection with them. Thus resulting in our universe having a perfect orbiter, whereas magnus having our lander in perfect and working condition. But still, we see vikram on moon and its presence has been confirmed by ISRO as well as NASA. What we have seen is not a physical object, rather it's an image of vikram of the time of it's landing in the Magnus which has been there due to the trapping of photons(because of extreme mass as speed went higher than light)in that particular place and time which shows the exact same image of vikram. It's not that Vikram is not sending signals or it has lost contact, it's just that tgese signals are being recieved in a parallel universe which is creating the whole perplex. Vikram is working extremely well, but in Magnus and all we see here are the stuck photons of it. By fate, this mission belongs to both the universes equally with each one having a single working part of chandrayaan. For one universe it's a failure, for the eternity it's the parallel perplex.</p>

            <p class="story-card" onclick="showMore(event)">Mission Chandrayan 2 the second lunar exploration mission developed by the ISRO.The day 22 july 2019 was so prestigious for all I dians.But something very bad happened .Vikram Lander lost its connection.On september 7 duri g the last houra of descent the communication link snapoed with vikram lander when it ws about to reach on the surface of the moo .ISRO chief assured that the lander was not broken.ISRO teied to restore link with the lander.Till the late night this dream was proceeding like a dream. Suddenly orbiter started changing its velocity from 1cm per second to 1.45 per second.This was quite different from the escape velocity. Due to this technical error it starts diverting ita path whichaffects its landing .The reasons for velocity difference was the steady loss of altitude dueing its first phase.This variation in velocity led to change ita path by greater angle.This predication cant be considered wrong that chandrayaan2 had landed but with some technical issues .Before this moment all connections sbapoed bit the trajectory of the orbitee showed a steep dip. Thank You</p>

            <p class="story-card" onclick="showMore(event)">What happens if Chandrayaan 2 lost his connection? Firstly I wish it will never happen but if… After half an hour of launch Chandrayaan 2 lost his connection with the ISRO. Everyone in Satish Dhawan Space Center becomes upset but don’t lose hope. But no one knows, what is going to happen. Nobody knows that an alien ship with parasites is heading towards the planet earth. These parasites control the host brain and also shows cannibalism Due to the intergalactic court order, these parasites are sent to planet earth to destroy the human race by the Aliens who create the first human race. These alien wants to resettle over the earth but they came to know that from the surveillance crafts which are observing the humans movement. They came to know that if they itself attack over Earth there must change that they lose some of their kind. So they come with an idea to kill the human race by humans. They decide to send parasites on earth which in the host body show cannibalism. When the parasite capsule shaped like a rock is heading towards earth. It reaches the earth orbit it came in front of Chandrayaan 2. But suddenly before the time of the crash. The connection is again established. The team in Satish Dhawan Space Center got an alert something the same size of Chandrayaan 2 is heading toward it. All computers start to giving alert ... then there is silence all around the center. Chandrayaan 2 crashed with an asteroid. Their capsule is hit by the Chandrayaan 2. In this crash, all the parasites are killed which saved the whole human race. But no one on earth came to know what happens because of the the impact was so powerful that the Chandrayaan and the asteroid both get vaporized. Everyone in India become very upset due to this crash. Nobody came to know in the world get an idea of how big threatened the whole human race is gone. The Alien become very upset and got frightened that humans destroy their parasite weapon to kill the whole human race... But at last, it is just a frictional story I wish never happen... Long live ISRO…</p>

            <p class="story-card" onclick="showMore(event)">Chandrayan 2 lander deviated from its intended trajectory starting at 2.1 kilometres (1.3 mi) altitude, and had lost communication when touchdown confirmation was expected. Does this delay has some other possible reasons. Yes, and many people agree with it. The reasons given below are some views collected from social media, cosmologists, alien enthusiasts, etc. The reasons are : 1. Interference of Bilderberg, Illuminati or other underground agency : The Delay was created by higher internal world agencies. It may be Bilderberg or Illuminati etc. This delay will give Aliens on the moon, a little time to shift their temporary establishment on the surface of the moon to the inside of hollow moon so that existence of Aliens still remain secret and intact. The main focus will be on two craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N, at a latitude of about 70° south on which Chandrayaan-2 landers will land. 2. The US - Russia's secret military base on the moon : Many alien researchers and theorists believe that the US and Russia jointly have a secret base on the moon for any potential intergalactic war in the future. Some even say that cold war between US and USSR was just to fool the world and during the cold war, Alien contacts were made, alien technologies were reverse-engineered. Many agencies don't want ISRO to interfere in it and the military establishment on the moon is camouflaged during the delay. 3. Aliens are in direct contact with ISRO : Some internet posts in the dark web reveal that ISRO may be in direct contact with the extraterrestrials. And the reason for the delay is something internal and a part of protocols and strategic cooperation between the two. Well, the reason may be just a technical snag but such possibilities can't be ignored if the incidents regarding Apollo missions are correct. There is no doubt that other space agencies are hiding something from us and ISRO may reveal it soon.</p>

            <h2>Rohit Kumar</h2>
            <p class="story-card" onclick="showMore(event)">India the land of resonance of extremities signed an agreement on 12 November 2007 with Russian federal agency (ROSCOMOS) for the upheaval of amission called Chandrayaan 2 aimed at the exploration of the lunar surface, where it was mutually decided that ISRO will handle the responsibilities of components called orbiter andr over while ROSCOMOS will dot the same for vikram lander, but due to some technical glitches in the vikram lander as it was inherently a tough task to build a system which could land without any damage to its internal system, thus as on 2015 due to failure of ROSCOSMOS to come up with an optimal solution for Vikram Lander, India decided to take responsibility on its own shoulders. Thus on 22nd july 2019 spacecraft was launched from the Satish Dhawan center by GSLV MK3 and from then on to 06/08/2019 it did 5 orbit raising maneauvers and finally on 13/08/2019 performed the lunar injection, thus entering in to the gravitational pull of moon and from there on to 1/09/2019 performed 5 lunar bound maneuvers and finally on 2/09/2019 led to separation of VIkrama lander from the orbiter and thus leading the mission to tis near culmination and then on performed 2 deorbit burns with respective burn times of 4 and 9 sec and thus finally on 6 sept 2019 the descent of vikram lander to the moon surface started bringing the country of 1.3 Billions in unison and a normal activity of the same until an altitude of 2.1 km 8:30 pm (IST) from lunar surface was observed and from then on the lander deviated from its expected trajectory and thus the speculation of a crash due to magnetic pull of moon seemed plausible explanation being the lag in working of fifth piston of vikram thus hindering its actual path and making it land in the shadowed portion of moon where it separated the pragyan rover from its body and thus leading to its movement in that shadowed portion for one lunar day and thus after being halted leaving the footprints of ISRO and Indian emblem which seems to be in resonance with the recent reports of NASA where they reported that no trace of its landing was founded by their moon orbiter</p>

            <h2>Gaurav Pandey</h2>
            <p class="story-card" onclick="showMore(event)">According to me,as chandrayaan 2 lost contact with th ground control in Sriharikota and Bangalore,it must have has a velocity of impact greater than anticipated for soft landing resulting in a harder landing.But since these landers are tested for these unexpected situations,it must have survived the potential catastrophic collosion with lunar surface.But since the south pole of the moon is comparatively farther from the Earth,it could not re-establish communication with deep space antennas hence resulting in the next part of the mission,i.e.,the rover launching and experiments being unconducted.Further since the batteries had storage for one lunar day,i.e.,14 days,it must have gone dead after this period of time.Also even if its battery managed to power it,the harsh and extreme weather during the 14 day long lunar night must have had a worse impact on the machinary leading to an end to the mission's hope of performing experiments through a rover on the lunar surface and recovering potential sources of essential minerals on the lunatic craters and volcanic peaks.</p>
